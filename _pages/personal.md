I'm from India where I travelled across the nation with my family and grew up studying in multiple schools. Interacting with people from varied backgrounds and experiencing many diverse cultures from a young age, I've always been comfortable in interacting with people. I was also active in debating and science exhibition clubs, which has contributed to my passion for research.<br><br>In my free time I like to play the guitar, listen to music or play basketball or tennis. I also love travelling and hiking. Check out some of the pictures from my hikes [here](https://maitreygram.github.io/personal/hike).
